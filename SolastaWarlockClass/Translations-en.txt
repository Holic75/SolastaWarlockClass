Subclass/&WarlockSubclassPatronOfNatureDescription	Warlocks from the Patron of Nature endeavor to protect the balance that exists between all living things. Members of this Patron are more at home in the wilderness than a rowdy tavern or royal court. They feel the connection that binds all life together and sustain its harmony.\nMost of these bards revere the forces of nature themselves, but some devote themselves to Aubori or one of the many nature gods in the multiverse. While all life is precious to Patron of Nature bards, they also know that nature can provide sustenance and utility to those who only take life when needed.\nWhen a member of this Patron performs, it can seem as if nature itself joins in with rustling leaves, whistling winds, crashing waves, and singing birds. They harm only those who needlessly take lives, despoil nature, or use dark magic to go against nature's balance. For their protection of nature, they receive magical energy in return.
